## Lyrics

```
here’s to all the grunts (cunts) - who
never seen the other side
stuck up, proper done (dumb) booo
never been to other people’s side
poison helps - my brother
got no blood - none to hold down 
feel like snapping egos - murda

with an absolute power
sorry for the honesty
makes you throw it on the ground
and kill, iiii (murda)
gotta beee honest
just like you pretend to be
just like you
pretend to be
aye

all i require justice, slightly admitting
to a fallacy, hurting deep (indeed)
hurting deep yeah
pruned and wanted to be called
one-sided story for a collared dog
for a collared dog


 accurate assumptions
sorry for the honesty

now i’m gonna be honest


with all my actually accurate assumptions

- on the ground

but i require justice just like admitting
to fallacy, hurting deep 




judgement is my domain

here’s to all the cunts - fuck off

sunk but you feel on top

```
